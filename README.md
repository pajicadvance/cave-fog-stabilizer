# Cave Fog Stabilizer

When Mojang added environmental fog to the game, the time of day started affecting how fog looks underground. I thought this didn't make sense, so I made this mod.

This mod prevents fog from being affected by the time of day **only when the player is underground**. This lets you have the new environmental fog on the surface while keeping cave fog unaffected.

Check out the Gallery tab for comparison images between this mod, vanilla after environmental fog, and vanilla before environmental fog.

The mod provides a configuration when Fzzy Config is installed, but it's not required for the mod to do its thing. The configuration allows the following:
- Toggling underground fog stabilization on and off (default enabled, obviously).
- Changing the time it takes to transition from environmental fog to stabilized fog and vice versa when moving between the surface and underground (default 5 seconds).
- Changing the color the fog ends up stabilizing to after the transition time passes (default black, identical to what cave fog visuals were before).
